# CTS Homework 2
Being given the Student Class code, implement a JUnit-based test system to verify that the addNota(int), getNota(int) and medieAritmetica() methods are correctly implemented for different input data sets. Otherwise, the methods will be corrected. The test system must contain, at the level of each tested method, at least:

• 3 Right tests;

• 1 test to verify a condition for which the function being tested generates an exception;

• 2 tests to check extreme limits;

• 2 tests to verify otherwise than the above.

Being given the method header for the notaFrecventaMaxima(), implement the function body so that it returns the grade that appears most often in the student's grades list. If two or more grades have the same frequency, the highest value will be displayed. (Statistically, is displayed the highest modal value of the grades list). For the notaFrecventaMaxima () method, the following unit tests must be implemented:

• 3 Right tests;

• 1 cross-check test;

• 1 inverse relationship test;

• 2 tests to verify other conditions than the above.

For each method, a test case is created that contains all test methods related to the method. All test cases will be run together in a suite test. Create also a test suite of tests that contains only certain test units (you can freely choose which one) from the implemented test cases

The project can be done using JUnit3 or JUnit4.

The implementation of the project involves the correction (refactoring) and implementation of the Student class methods as well as the test cases and suites. Each method will contain the condition type in the test name. (Eg testGetNotaCrossCheck ()).

Important

The project can be done in NetBeans, Eclipse or IntelliJ. The project archive has a Tema3_ [group] _ [name_name] like name. The solution is packaged in a .zip archive (not RAR or 7zip) named: Assignment2_[group]_[surname_name].zip and uploaded to the online.ase.ro platform
